# SoftwareModelingAndDesing_Project
This is our software Modeling and Design project for the SWE 202 course.

Our group has choosen the Rental Management System topic for our project.We will ensure the creation of a proper model encompassing all the steps necessary to fulfill its role as a design worthy of simplifying the work of the software engineers to turn the theoritical aspect into a practical one.Our duty in this project is for all the lessons of the SWE 202 course to be incorporated into our project, for example: Requirements Engineering, different Modelings, Desing Patterns, etc.
